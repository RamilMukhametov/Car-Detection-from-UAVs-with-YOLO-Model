# Car-Detection-from-UAVs-with-YOLO-Model

### Project Objective

Train a machine learning model to detect passenger cars on board a UAV in real time

<br>

### Requirements for the machine learning model:
**1. Accuracy:** Detect passenger cars with an accuracy of at least 90%;

**2. Speed:** Operate in real-time;

**3. Resources:** The model must run on equipment available on board the UAV, maximizing computational power while minimizing weight. For example: Jetson Nano or Jetson Xavier NX;

**4. Energy consumption:** Minimal energy consumption to reduce UAV flight time as little as possible (Jetson Nano: 5-10 W, Jetson Xavier NX: 10-20 W).
